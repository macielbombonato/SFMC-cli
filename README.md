# SFMC-cli
App to build and maintain the cloud project locally (versioning).

## About

The idea of this app is to create a local repository that represents the structure of the Marketing Cloud, so, it is possible to edit, versioning, and publish your updates. If something wrong happens, it will be easy to recovery the last change.  
  
It is based on FuelSDK and try to be a shortcut for some features of it.  
  
## How it works
- First you will execute it to download all updatable assets (data extensions, cloud pages, automations, and so on).  
- Then you will made your changes locally, verify and publish it (sync)
- If something wrong happens, you can restore the last version locally and re-publish it.
